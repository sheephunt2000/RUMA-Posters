\textsc{Abstract:}

\Large 
Symplectic geometry arose as a mathematical framework 
for Hamiltonian dynamics in physics and is now one of the most active
areas of research in mathematics, especially focused on the "mirror symmetry
conjectures' relating symplectic and algebraic geometry and the "Arnold conjectures" 
on time-dependent Hamiltonian flows.

\vspace{2mm}
I'll give a quick introduction to symplectic geometry based on the following 
real life problem:  Put a rubber band around your favorite math book 
and throw it in the air, with the cover facing you, and try to catch
it after it's done a 360 degree rotation, but catching it with the cover
facing you. Why is this so hard?  You may wish to bring a book to the talk (either to flip or to read if the talk gets boring.)\\
