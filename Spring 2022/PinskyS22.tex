\textsc{Abstract:}

\large
You and your countably many friends are being held captive by an
evil set theorist.  Tomorrow, they will give each of you a hat
that is one of countably many colors (multiple people may have the
same color).  Then you will all simultaneously try to guess your
hat's color.  You can see everyone else's hat, but not your own.
You lose if infinitely many of your friends guess wrong. 

\vspace{2mm} 
Assuming the axiom of choice, your friends have a winning
strategy.  However, assuming the axiom of choice lets the evil set
theorist cheat and Banach-Tarski the finite set of friends who
guess wrong into infinitely many friends, and you still lose. 

\vspace{2mm} 
Is there an axiom that is strong enough for your friends to win,
but too weak for the set theorist to cheat?  In this talk, we'll
explore strictly weaker versions of the axiom of choice, and
hopefully find an answer.
